# Header files and Namespaces

## Accessing methods using **header files** and **namespaces**

In C++, we access pre-defined methods and functions by two ways.

- The first is to `#include` certain header files and use methods declared and defined within said header files.

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string.h>
    
    int main() {
        ...
        
        char string[5] = "hello";
        char copy_string[5];

        strcpy(copy_string, string); 
        
        ...
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    Here, `strcpy()` is a method defined within the `<string.h>` header file.

- The second is to use the name of a particular namespace along with a scope resolution operator, followed by the name of the method.

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main() {
        ...

        std::cout << "hello world" << std::endl;
        
        ...
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    Here, we are using the method `cout` and `endl` which are a part of the `std` namespace. 

## Need of both **Header files** and **namespaces**

Namespaces and header files are inherently different in function.

### What are Header Files?

Header files are actual files - stored in the file system. It is intended to be included by source files. They typically contain declarations of certain classes and functions.

### What is a Namespace?

A namespace enables code to categorize identifiers. That is, classes, functions, etc. can be placed inside a namespace, keeping those separate from other classes that are unrelated. 

They don't exist as a file system object, but rather as a designation within code telling the compiler that certain things are within that namespace. 

For instance, the `std` namespace in C++ contains all of the Standard Library functions and classes.


Header file would be a unique file on a file system and namespace would be covering one or more files.
i.e. Header file is a **physical thing** and namespace is a **logical thing**.
