/*
* 1. What is a Friend Function?

Like friend class, a friend function can be given a special grant to access PRIVATE and PROTECTED members. 

A friend function is a function that is specified outside a class but has the ability to access 
the class membersâ€™ protected and private data.

A friend function can be any of the TWO: 
a) A member of another class 
b) A global function 

* 2. Benefits of Friend Function over Member Functions of a class

? The benefit of using friend functions instead of member functions defined 
? within a class is that MEMBER functions are implicitly made INLINE 
? which is good for speed but can cause some functional problems.

! Member functions are USEFUL in case of short codes that will benefit from
! reduced time of creating a function call stack.

* 3. Syntax for declaring a Friend Function

class <class-name> {
    friend <return-type> <function-name> (argument/s);
    ...
    ...
};
