/*
* Friend Class

A friend class can access PRIVATE and PROTECTED members of other class in which it is declared as friend. 
It is sometimes useful to allow a particular class to access private members of other class.


* Important points about friendship

- Friendship is not mutual. If class A is a friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become a friend of A automatically.
- Friendship is not inherited
