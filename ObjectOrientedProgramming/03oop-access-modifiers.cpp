/*
There are 3 kinds of access modifiers: public, private and protected. 
The default access modifier in a class is PRIVATE

* public 

The public keyword is used to create public members (data and functions).
The public members are accessible from any part of the program.

Notice that the public elements are accessible from main(). 
This is because public elements are accessible from all parts of the program.

* private

The private keyword is used to create private members (data and functions).

The private members can only be accessed from within the class.

! NOTE that private members are inherited by derived classes. 
! They even occupy memory when instances of the derived classes are created.
? But, they still can't be accessed from anywhere EXCEPT from within the base class.

However, friend classes and friend functions can access private members.

* protected

PROTECTED access modifier is similar to private access modifier in the sense that 
it canâ€™t be accessed outside of its class unless with the help of friend class.

The difference is that the class members declared as Protected can be accessed by any 
subclass(derived class) of that class as well.
