/*
* Intermediate Code

When we compiler this program using the compiler, an executable file containing 
intermediate code of BINARY FILE FORMAT is created.

When we run this newly created executable file, we get the output of our program.

? This newly created file can now be run independent of the presence of the source code.

? Intermediate code lies between the high-level language and the machine language. 

If the compiler directly translates source code into the machine code without generating 
intermediate code then a full native compiler is required for each new machine.

TODO: Refer README.md of Learning-with-C repository to understand where these binary files are stored.
